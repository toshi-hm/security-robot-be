## 🛠️ Environment & setup
- Provision the Python environment with `uv`: run `uv venv`, then `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Start the API server with `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` or `uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.
- When Redis, Celery, or other infrastructure is required, consult `README.md` for service configuration details.

## ✅ Workflow expectations
1. Begin every session by reviewing `report/PROGRESS.md`, `report/summary/DIARY01.md`, `report/summary/DIARY02.md`, `report/summary/DIARY03.md`, `report/summary/DIARY04.md`, `report/summary/DIARY05_SUMMARY.md`, and `report/DIARY06.md` to capture current objectives and context.
   - Lean on the summary files to refresh long-running context before diving into the detailed diary logs.
2. Study the applicable design documents and prompts before editing code to ensure that acceptance criteria and constraints are satisfied.
3. Follow strict test-driven development: introduce or update tests first, then implement code, and keep running `pytest` until the suite succeeds.
4. Close each session by updating `report/PROGRESS.md` and logging a new entry in `report/DIARY06.md` that summarizes the changes and decisions.

## 🔍 Review & prompt usage
- When performing reviews, follow the prompts located in [`instructions/prompts`](instructions/prompts), especially [`02_codex_review_prompt.md`](instructions/prompts/02_codex_review_prompt.md) when coordinating with Codex outputs.
- For implementation assignments, lean on guides such as `00_implementation_guide.md` and `01_backend_implementation_guide.md` to align with architectural expectations.

## 🧪 Testing & quality gates
- Execute `pytest` to cover unit and integration paths, expanding scenarios in line with the documented test plan as needed.
- Apply additional security or performance checks for sensitive changes, referencing the architecture and reinforcement learning design documents for specific criteria.

## 📏 Coding Standards

### Grid Indexing Convention

In this project, we unify 2D grid indexing to **row-major** format:

- **Format:** `grid[y][x]` or `grid[row][col]`
- **Reason:**
  - Consistency with NumPy standard format
  - Simplification of data exchange with frontend
  - Consistency with mathematical matrix notation

**Example:**
```python
# ✅ Correct
obstacles = [[False for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
if obstacles[y][x]:  # y=row, x=col
    ...

# ❌ Incorrect
obstacles = [[False for _ in range(height)] for _ in range(width)]
if obstacles[x][y]:
    ...
```
